As the slider moves to the right, the normal strain block is deformed from a square to rectangle and tilted to the left. As theta increases, Mohrâ€™s circle for strain changes the location of A and the radius stays the same and moves into the positive x-y quadrant. As theta changes, the location of the radius changes along the circumference of the circle.</div>
